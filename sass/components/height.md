    5 Heights in the spirit

1.) Height above distructions(off your soul) - press in prayers and meditations
2.) Realm in momentum(stamina in the spirit)- focus in the place of prayer
3.) Realm of fire in prayer - you're charged in prayers - here you're a weapon - you can't go above this unless you're summoned (jude 1 : 20)..building up in the most holy faith
Wait and see what you'll be told 
prayer silences your spirit because it breaks distraction, and prayer charges your spirit that u can bring ministry to people who luck.
4.) Realm of the voice in prayer - you're summoned begin to shape you/making you
Realm of judgement - Now you're sent as an ambassador(as a living epistle)
